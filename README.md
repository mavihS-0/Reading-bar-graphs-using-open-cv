# Bar Graph to CSV Converter

This Python script converts a bar graph input into a CSV file containing data points along the x and y axes.

## Overview

This script takes a bar graph image as input and uses image processing techniques to extract data points from the graph. It identifies the bars, measures their positions along the x-axis, and computes their corresponding y-axis values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `csv`
  - `opencv-python (cv2)`
  - `numpy(optional)`

## Usage

### Input
- Replace `bar.png` with the path to your bar graph image. The output will be saved as `output.csv`.

### Output Format
- The generated CSV file contains data points with x and y coordinates representing the positions and heights of the bars on the graph.
